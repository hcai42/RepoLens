# Changelog

All notable changes to RepoLens will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `--local` flag: write findings as local markdown files instead of creating GitHub issues — no `gh` CLI required
- `--output <path>` flag: custom output directory for local markdown files (requires `--local`, defaults to `logs/<run-id>/issues/`)

### Documentation

- "Adding a Lens" section in README now links to CONTRIBUTING.md for the full contribution workflow (fork, branch, PR process)

### Security

- `.gitignore` now covers common sensitive file patterns (`.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.jks`, `*.keystore`, `*.pfx`, `key.properties`, `google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`, `credentials.json`, `secrets.yaml`, `secrets.yml`) to prevent accidental secret commits. `.env.example` is excluded so contributors can commit environment variable templates

### Infrastructure

- GitHub Actions CI workflow: ShellCheck linting and test suite (`make check`) run on every push to `master` and pull request
- CI status badge in README
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` for automatic reviewer assignment on pull requests
- `.github/FUNDING.yml` to activate the GitHub "Sponsor" button linking to GitHub Sponsors and Patreon
