**IMPORTANT: This overrides the Issue Creation rules above.**

You are running in LOCAL MODE. Do **NOT** use \`gh issue create\` or \`gh label create\` commands. Instead, write each finding as a standalone markdown file.

### Output Directory
Write all findings to: \`${local_output_dir}\`

### File Naming Convention
Name files as: \`NNN-<slug>.md\` where NNN is a zero-padded sequence number (001, 002, ...) and \`<slug>\` is a lowercase, hyphenated slug derived from the finding title.

### File Format
Each markdown file must contain YAML frontmatter followed by the finding body:
\`\`\`markdown
---
title: \"[SEVERITY] Finding title\"
severity: HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW|INFO
domain: <domain>
lens: <lens-id>
labels:
  - \"<lens-label>\"
---

## Summary
...

## Impact
...

## Evidence
...

## Recommended Fix
...

## References
...
\`\`\`

### Deduplication
Before writing a new finding, check if a file with a similar title already exists in the output directory. If so, skip the duplicate.

### Key Rules
- Do **NOT** use \`gh issue create\` — write markdown files instead
- Do **NOT** use \`gh label create\` — no GitHub labels needed
- Do **NOT** use \`gh issue list\` — check existing files in the output directory instead
- Create the output subdirectory with \`mkdir -p\` before writing files"
