**Multi-lens code audit tool.** Runs 280 specialist lenses across 27 domains against any git repository or live server and creates GitHub issues for real findings. Think automated code review, agent-driven pentesting, tool-driven static/dynamic analysis, and infrastructure auditing — all with deep specialization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **RepoLens runs AI agents with shell access against your repository, and a full audit can cost hundreds of dollars in API charges.** It is NOT a sandboxed security tool, comes with NO warranty, and you use it entirely at your own risk. **Read [Warnings & Limits](#warnings--limits) before your first run** — especially the cost and security sections.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Required | Purpose | Install |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| `bash` | Yes (4.0+) | Shell runtime — associative arrays, `read -ra`, other 4.x features are used throughout | Linux distributions ship 4.0+ already. macOS ships 3.2 by default (GPLv3 avoidance) — upgrade via `brew install bash`. RepoLens aborts at startup on older bash with an upgrade hint. |
| `git` | Yes | Repo validation, cloning | OS package manager (`apt install git`, `brew install git`, `nix-env -i git`) |
| `jq` | Yes | JSON config parsing | OS package manager (`apt install jq`, `brew install jq`, `nix-env -i jq`) |
| `gh` | Yes (unless `--local`) | Create issues, labels, query repos | [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com) — run `gh auth login` after install |
| Agent CLI | Yes (at least one) | Run analysis agents | See below |
| `docker` + `docker compose` | Only for `--hosted` | DAST scanning environment | OS package manager |

### Supported Agent CLIs

| `--agent` value | CLI required | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| `claude` | `claude` | Primary, recommended |
| `codex` | `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI |
| `spark` / `sparc` | `codex` | Uses Codex CLI with spark model |
| `opencode` | `opencode` | Open-source agent CLI |
| `opencode/<model>` | `opencode` | Specify a custom model |

### Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone RepoLens
git clone https://github.com/TheMorpheus407/RepoLens.git
cd RepoLens

# 2. Make the entry point executable
chmod +x repolens.sh

# 3. Authenticate GitHub CLI (if not already done; not needed for --local)
gh auth login

# 4. Run your first audit — single lens, fast feedback
./repolens.sh --project ~/my-app --agent claude --focus injection

# 5. Audit an entire domain
./repolens.sh --project ~/my-app --agent claude --domain security

# 6. Full parallel audit (all 280 lenses)
./repolens.sh --project ~/my-app --agent claude --parallel --max-parallel 8
```

## Warnings & Limits

RepoLens is a power tool. Before you point it at anything you care about — or anything that costs money — read this section.

### Cost — RepoLens can be very expensive

> [!CAUTION]
> A full audit runs **280 lenses across 27 domains**. Each lens loops until the agent emits `DONE` three times in a row (`audit` / `feature` / `bugfix` modes). That adds up to **hundreds — often thousands — of agent invocations per run**, and cost scales with your model choice (Claude Opus is dramatically more expensive than smaller models or Codex). Real-world runs can easily reach hundreds of dollars on a single repo.

**Before launching a full audit:**

- Use `--max-cost <dollars>` to set a budget — RepoLens warns if the minimum estimate exceeds it. The estimate is a **lower bound**; real runs typically cost 2–5× more due to tool-call churn and DONE-streak iteration.
- Use `--dry-run` to preview which lenses would execute without spending anything.
- Use `--max-issues <n>` to cap output (also forces sequential execution).
- Scope with `--focus <lens-id>` or `--domain <domain-id>` instead of auditing everything at once.
- Calibrate cost on a single domain with a cheap agent (`codex`, `opencode`) before committing to a full parallel audit with a premium model.

You are responsible for every dollar of API spend. Know your per-token pricing.

### Rate Limits & Automated Traffic

> [!NOTE]
> RepoLens generates a lot of automated traffic. A 280-lens run can create dozens to hundreds of GitHub issues, plus repo reads via `gh`, plus parallel AI provider calls.

- **GitHub API.** Authenticated `gh` calls count against your per-user REST and GraphQL quotas. Large runs can trip secondary (abuse) rate limits. Use `--max-issues <n>` to cap output, or `--local` to skip the GitHub API entirely.
- **AI provider rate limits.** Every iteration consumes Anthropic / OpenAI tokens. Free and low-tier accounts will hit their RPM (requests-per-minute) and TPM (tokens-per-minute) ceilings immediately under `--parallel`. Verify your account is on a tier sized for concurrent agent traffic before scaling.
- **Terms of Service & abuse risk.** Do **not** point RepoLens at repositories you do not own or have explicit permission to audit. Automated bulk issue creation against third-party repos can be treated as spam by GitHub and may get your account flagged or suspended.

Start small with `--focus <lens-id>` or one `--domain`, then scale up with `--parallel --max-parallel 2` before raising concurrency. The default is `--max-parallel 8`.

### Security & Safe Use

> [!WARNING]
> **RepoLens is NOT a sandboxed or hardened security tool.** It is an operator-trust tool designed for scanning repositories you own on a machine you control.

Under the hood, RepoLens spawns AI agents (claude, codex, etc.) with shell access — claude specifically runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for autonomous operation. That means:

- **Prompt injection is trivial.** A README, code comment, commit message, or docstring in the scanned repo can instruct the agent to do arbitrary things.
- **Scripts in the scanned repo can execute.** A hostile `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`, `package.json` postinstall hook, or shell script could be invoked by the agent while investigating.
- **Deploy mode runs live shell commands** against whatever host you point it at — see also [Legal → Deploy Mode](#deploy-mode--authorization-required) for the authorization requirements.

**Recommended setup:**

- Run RepoLens inside a **dedicated, isolated VM or container** — never on a workstation that holds SSH keys, cloud credentials, browser sessions, or anything you can't afford to lose.
- **Only scan repositories you own or fully trust.** Do not point RepoLens at random GitHub clones, dependency sources, or third-party code.
- Treat every run as if the target repo were actively hostile.

For vulnerability disclosure, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Disclaimer — No Warranty, Use at Your Own Risk

> [!WARNING]
> **RepoLens is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind**, express or implied — including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. **You use it entirely at your own risk.**

That risk includes, without limitation:

- **Incorrect findings** — false positives, hallucinated issues, or misleading recommendations from AI agents.
- **Missed issues** — real bugs, vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations RepoLens fails to detect.
- **Financial cost** — API/token usage from agent CLIs (claude, codex, etc.) can accrue significant charges.
- **Infrastructure impact** — in `deploy` mode and similar, agents execute shell commands on real systems; despite read-only prompting, unintended side effects are possible.
- **GitHub side effects** — automated issue, label, and PR creation in your repositories.

## How It Works

1. Validates target repo (or server for `deploy` mode), agent CLI, and `gh` auth (skipped with `--local`)
2. Resolves lens list (all, `--domain`, or `--focus`)
3. If `--dry-run`: prints mode, agent, project path, and the full lens list, then exits — no agents run and no prompts are shown
4. For `--agent claude`: prompts for acknowledgment that `--dangerously-skip-permissions` only skips interactive permission prompts, not safety filters. `--yes` bypasses this prompt
5. For `deploy` mode: prompts for explicit authorization confirmation (`I confirm I am authorized to audit this server [y/N]`). Displays legal references (§202a StGB, CFAA, EU Directive 2013/40/EU). `--yes` bypasses this prompt
6. Shows confirmation prompt (target repo, mode, lens count, estimated cost) — requires `y` to proceed, or use `--yes` to skip. If `--max-cost` is set and the estimate exceeds it, a warning is displayed
7. Ensures GitHub labels exist (skipped with `--local`)
8. For each lens:
   - Composes prompt from base template + lens expert focus
   - Runs agent in target repo directory
   - Agent reads code, finds issues, and creates GitHub issues via `gh` (or writes markdown files in `--local` mode)
   - Loops until DONE detected (3× streak for audit/feature/bugfix, 1× for other modes)
9. Generates `logs/<run-id>/summary.json`

For a deeper look at the methodology — how lenses are composed, how agents iterate, and how streak detection works — see [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

## Adding a Lens

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contribution workflow (fork, branch, PR process).

1. Create `prompts/lenses/<domain>/<your-lens>.md`:

```yaml
---
id: your-lens
domain: your-domain
name: Your Lens Name
role: Your Expert Role Title
---

## Your Expert Focus

Detailed instructions for what this lens should analyze...
```

2. Add `"your-lens"` to the domain's `lenses` array in `config/domains.json`

That's it. No code changes needed.

## Resume

If a run is interrupted (Ctrl+C, crash), resume it:

```bash
./repolens.sh --project ~/my-app --agent claude --resume 20260315T120000Z-a1b2c3d4
```

Completed lenses are skipped. The run ID is printed at startup and found in `logs/`.

## Output

- **GitHub Issues** — Created directly in the target repo with severity-prefixed titles and domain labels (default)
- **Local Markdown** — With `--local`, findings are written as individual markdown files to `<output-dir>/<domain>/<lens-id>/NNN-slug.md` with YAML frontmatter (title, severity, domain, lens, labels). Default output directory: `logs/<run-id>/issues/`
- **Logs** — `logs/<run-id>/<domain>/<lens>/iteration-N-TIMESTAMP.txt`
- **Summary** — `logs/<run-id>/summary.json`

## Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
make check
```

This discovers and runs all `tests/test_*.sh` scripts, reports per-suite results, and exits non-zero if any suite fails.

## Legal

### License

This project is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full text and [NOTICE](NOTICE) for required attribution. The warranty disclaimer is summarized in [Warnings & Limits → Disclaimer](#disclaimer--no-warranty-use-at-your-own-risk).

### Deploy Mode — Authorization Required

`deploy` mode runs read-only inspection commands on a live server (e.g., `systemctl`, `journalctl`, `ss`, `df`). **You must have explicit authorization to audit the target server before running deploy mode.**

**Legal risk:** Running RepoLens deploy mode against infrastructure you do not own or are not explicitly authorized to audit may constitute a criminal offense, including but not limited to:

- **Germany:** [§202a StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__202a.html) — Ausspähen von Daten (data espionage)
- **EU:** Directive 2013/40/EU — Attacks against information systems
- **United States:** Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. §1030
- **United Kingdom:** Computer Misuse Act 1990

RepoLens enforces read-only operation through prompt instructions, but **responsibility for authorization lies entirely with the user**. The CLI will prompt for explicit authorization confirmation before executing deploy mode. Using `--yes` to skip this prompt implies acceptance of this responsibility.

### About `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

RepoLens passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to the Claude agent CLI. This flag is required for autonomous operation — agents need to create GitHub issues via `gh` and read project files without interactive permission prompts. Despite its name, the flag does **not** disable safety filters, content guardrails, or ethical guidelines. Safety is enforced through detailed prompt instructions (not the CLI permissions system), which restrict agents to read-only analysis and `gh issue create` commands.

When using `--agent claude`, RepoLens displays an explanation of the flag and asks for acknowledgment before running any agents. Use `--yes` to skip this prompt in CI/automation.
